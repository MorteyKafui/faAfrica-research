    title: 'International Relations',
    content:
      'This course aims at exposing and deepening doctoral students’ understanding of the epistemological underpinnings of the social sciences. It focuses on the differences and similarities between the social and natural sciences, causal relationships, social laws, and the ontological significance of structure and agency. It also seeks to elucidate the nature of scientific enquiry and evaluate the grounds of their validity. Students will be exposed to social science explanatory frameworks, such as the humanistic approach, realism, post-modernism, and post-structuralism.',

      'The course provides students with presuppositions, methods, practices and products of quantitative research in the social sciences. Quantitative analytical approaches allow the reporting of summary results in numerical terms to be given with a specified degree of confidence. Quantitative analysis approaches are particularly helpful when the qualitative information has been collected in some structured way. The course, therefore, links the qualitative approaches with the quantitative, paying attention to data structure.',

      'This course provides a platform, upon which to interrogate gendered international relations by exploring a variety of salient issues, from theoretical underpinnings of IR to empirical questions of state sovereignty, peace and security, political economy, development, human rights, democracy, and global governance.  The course relies on gender scholarship to deepen the understanding of gender in international affairs.  The course examines and deploys perspectives from feminism, (including Feminist Security Theory), gender studies, cultural studies, and sexuality studies, in conjunction with inter-disciplinary research in international political economy, civil-military relations, international development, and the study of men and masculinities. A variety of techniques will be used to deliver the course, among which include: lectures, group work, and an individual research project.',

    title: 'Comparative Regional Integration',
    content:
      'The course explores the extent and limits of contemporary international ethics and examines the ways in which the international community has responded to some of the most crucial challenges to the rationalization of international behaviour. It touches on theoretical debates (how various ethical traditions deal with the central moral problems of international affairs) and examines engaging case studies on issues of morality and international affairs: just war theory, terrorism, political violence, humanitarian intervention, and global distributive justice. The course also interrogates contending theories on global normative behavior – cosmopolitanism (an agenda that seeks to humanize aspects of what might be loosely termed global public policy) and post-structuralist assumptions.',

    content:
      'The main activity of the second year of the PhD programme at LECIAD will be directed at guiding students to engage in projects that allow them to be abreast with, and well-grounded in research activities. Here, candidates will be required to be part of projects and/or programmes that demand the application of the theories and skills acquired to data analysis and report writing. These would include the practical demonstration of the methodologies to be employed in the PhD research. Students shall present reports at the end of their attachments.Students may therefore, be attached to projects that relate to their areas of research to enable them have valuable first-hand experience.Students are encouraged to seek sponsorship and attachment outside of Ghana to organizations/institutions such as the UN (New York), World Bank and the IMF (Washington D.C); the African Union (Addis Ababa); the Pan-African Parliament; the EU (Brussels); the Africa, Caribbean & Pacific Countries (Brussels); the ECOWAS (Abuja); etc., or any of Ghana’s Missions abroad. A Report is expected at the end of the attachment',

    title: 'International Economic Relations',
    content:
      'The purpose of the course is to critically explore the theories which underpin the discipline of international relations, with particular emphasis on interpretations and analysis (both classical and contemporary) of the international system. It aims at an exhaustive evaluation of such systemic and structural issues as power, regimes, security, national interest, leadership, war, conflict, hegemony, stability, change, development, regionalism, and integration.  The expectation is that this approach would provide the framework for an appreciation of the broad theoretical underpinnings of international relations, namely Classical Realism, Realism, Idealism, Utopianism, Neo-Realism, Pluralism, Liberalism, Globalism, Structuralism, post-Modernism, conflict theories and feminist theories, among others.',

    title: 'Political Development',
    content:
      'The course is designed to arm students with presuppositions, methods, practices and products of qualitative research in the social sciences. A team-taught course, it highlights the key theoretical postulates and concepts in qualitative methods of research. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. Emphasis will be placed on Content Analysis. Content analysis is a widely used qualitative research technique. Rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The course delineates analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques, addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of international relations.',

      'The course examines the structures of political and economic interaction among nation-states, particularly the decision-making processes in the international system. It identifies the nexus between politics and economics in relation to the institutional and organizational frameworks that drive decisions of states in nation-building and development. The course begins by examining a variety of theoretical approaches to IPE, the aim being to assist in developing a sophisticated understanding of the theories and concepts used to investigate and explain the structure and practices of contemporary global political-economic relations. It then profiles the role and impact of international financial institutions, trade organizations and other regulatory frameworks in these processes, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (IBRD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other United Nations affiliate agencies.',

Quantitative analysis approaches are particularly helpful when the qualitative information has been collected in some structured way. The course, therefore, links the qualitative approaches with the quantitative, paying attention to data structure. Data structure refers to the way in which the data can be visualized and categorized in different ways, largely as a result of the method of data collection. A team-taught course, it highlights the key theoretical postulates and concepts in quantitative methods of research.',
